My Journey with Music 🎶
Music has always been a profound part of my life. 🎼 I am deeply passionate about it, especially the piano. 
🎹 I believe that music is a universal language that can communicate emotions and ideas beyond words. 
🌍 During my undergraduate years, I performed once a year, each time deepening my appreciation for the art of music. 
🎤 One composer who has especially influenced me is Frédéric Chopin. 🎶 
His works, full of expression and technical elegance, resonate deeply with me. 🎵 
I hope you enjoy my music—check out my performances below! 🎧
