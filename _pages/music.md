## My Journey with Music 🎶

Music has always been a profound part of my life. 🎼 I am deeply passionate about it, especially the piano.
🎹 I believe that music is a universal language that can communicate emotions and ideas beyond words.
🌍 During my undergraduate years, I performed once a year, each time deepening my appreciation for the art of music.
🎤 One composer who has especially influenced me is **Frédéric Chopin**. 🎶
His works, full of expression and technical elegance, resonate deeply with me. 🎵
I hope you enjoy my music—check out my music below! 🎧
