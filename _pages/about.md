ðŸ‘‹ Welcome! I'm a dynamic researcher ðŸ§ , 
inventive game developer ðŸŽ®, 
and a passionate pianist ðŸŽ¹ with an unwavering love for Chopin ðŸŽ¼. 

With a strong foundation in computer science and electrical engineering, 
I specialize in pioneering brain-computer interface (BCI) technology. 
My work focuses on integrating advanced physiological data to create real-time, 
accessible signal processing solutions through machine learning and deep learning techniques. 
Driven by a desire to bridge gaps and create opportunities, I am dedicated to advancing Human-Computer Interaction and biomedical imaging to improve lives and make technology accessible to all.
