excerpt: 'PhysioLabXR is a Python-based open-source software platform for neuroscience and human-computer interaction (HCI) experiments, enabling real-time and multi-modal physiological data processing. The platform supports a variety of sensors including EEG, fNIRS, and eye trackers, while offering tools for multi-stream visualization, real-time digital signal processing (DSP), and experiment recording. With native support for popular data transfer protocols such as Lab Streaming Layer (LSL) and ZeroMQ (ZMQ), PhysioLabXR facilitates seamless integration and control over experimental pipelines. This tool serves as a foundation for future BCI and HCI experiments, significantly benefiting the research community.'

**Duration:** May 2020 – Present  
**Role:** Co-Founder, Lead Software Engineer, Co-First Author  
**Advisor:** [Dr. Steven K. Feiner](https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/faculty/steven-feiner) & [Dr. Paul Sajda](https://www.bme.columbia.edu/faculty/paul-sajda)

## Overview
PhysioLabXR is an open-source **Python-based software platform** designed for real-time 
**multi-modal brain-computer interfaces (BCI)** and **extended reality** experiments. 
The platform integrates data from various sensors, such as **EEG, EMG, fNIRS, and eye trackers**, 
to process and visualize physiological data in real-time, 
enabling seamless neuroscience and HCI experiments.

I co-founded PhysioLabXR with my friend _Ziheng 'Leo' Li_ during 
my sophomore year at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) and have continued its development 
through my time at Columbia University.
Over the last four years, I introduced PhysioLabXR to research labs across institutions, 
including the
**Laboratory for Intelligent Imaging and Neural Computing (LIINC)**,
**Computer Graphics and User Interfaces Lab (CGUI)**,and
**AI for Visualization Lab (AI4Vis)**
at Columbia University,
and Martinos Center **TMS Lab** at Harvard Medical School, 
as well as the **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) Lab** at WPI.

## Key Contributions
- **Leadership**: Led the platform development from concept to implementation, managing data visualization, device interfaces, and real-time signal processing modules.
- **Sensor Fusion**: Developed a comprehensive application for sensor fusion, integrating multiple data streams using the **Lab Streaming Layer (LSL)** protocol and supporting additional sensors through serial connections.
- **User Education**: Created multiple **demonstration Brain-Computer Interface paradigms**, such as the P300 Speller, to help researchers adopt and utilize the platform.
- **Experiment Pipeline**: Enabled users to perform **real-time neural network inference** and gain full control over their experimental pipeline with **customizable DSP modules**.

## Novelty
- Developed an innovative platform that provides **real-time multi-stream data visualization and processing**, making it a valuable tool for both BCI and HCI research communities.
- The platform’s ability to integrate various sensors and process large datasets in real-time sets a foundation for future research in **neurotechnology** and **extended reality**.
