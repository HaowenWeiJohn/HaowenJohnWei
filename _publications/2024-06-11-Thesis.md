excerpt: "My master's thesis focuses on the development of innovative tools and methods in brain-computer interfaces (BCI), human-computer interaction (HCI), and extended reality (XR). It comprises three key projects. PhysioLabXR, a Python-based platform, provides a versatile environment for real-time, multi-modal BCI and XR experiments. This open-source software addresses the need for an all-in-one solution, facilitating data processing, visualization, and machine learning pipelines in various research domains. The second project, Interactively Assisting Glaucoma Diagnosis with an Expert Knowledge-distilled Vision Transformer, leverages deep learning to enhance clinical decision-making. By submitting this work to CHI 2025, we aim to introduce a novel AI-based diagnostic tool that empowers ophthalmologists with augmented diagnostic insights. Lastly, the third project, In Search for an Intuitive and Efficient Text-Entry in Mixed Reality: Tap, Gaze & Pinch, SwEYEpe, investigates innovative text-entry techniques in mixed reality environments. Targeted at CHI 2025 Late-Breaking Work, this research seeks to enhance user interaction in MR by exploring intuitive and efficient input methods. Together, these projects represent a comprehensive approach to advancing HCI and BCI research, offering new tools and methodologies for both medical and interactive technologies."
