excerpt: "My master's thesis at Columbia University focuses on the integration of Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs), Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), and AI-enhanced diagnostics to advance medical and interactive technologies. It encompasses three projects: PhysioLabXR, an open-source Python platform facilitating real-time, multi-modal physiological data processing and interaction in extended reality environments; Virtual Vitality, a clinical image diagnosis tool utilizing attention layers from vision transformers to augment decision-making in virtual settings (submitted to CHI 2025); and IndexPen, a radar-based interaction technique enabling touch-free, in-air text input with millimeter-wave radar (submitted to CHI 2025). These projects collectively aim to deepen the integration of neuroscience and technology, paving the way for innovative applications in both clinical and virtual environments."
