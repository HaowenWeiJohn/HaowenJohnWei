**Duration:** Sep 2023 â€“ Present    
**Role:** Project Lead, Lead Software Engineer, Experimenter   
**Advisor:** [Dr. Steven K. Feiner](https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/faculty/steven-feiner)     
**Status:** *Preparing for [CHI 2025 Late-Breaking Work](https://chi2025.acm.org)*



**Overview:**  
Sweyepe explores intuitive text-entry methods in mixed reality (MR), combining modalities such as tapping, gaze, pinching, and swiping. This multi-modal interaction aims to provide a natural and seamless text-entry experience in MR environments. The system filters gaze paths using a fixation detection algorithm and matches the user's gaze path with an ideal one. It further refines word candidates using a language model to enhance the accuracy of text input.

**Key Features:**
- **Multi-Modal Interaction:** Combines various input modalities to offer natural text-entry experiences in MR.
- **User-Centric Design:** Focuses on usability and efficiency, ensuring that text-entry methods are intuitive for users.
- **Evaluation:** Conducted user studies to assess the effectiveness of the proposed methods in improving MR interaction.

**My Contributions:**
- **Foundation Development:** Built the project's foundation, including both the front-end and back-end systems.
- **Gesture and Eye Tracking System:** Invented the gesture and eye-tracking based input system, enabling intuitive text entry through gaze path tracking.
- **System Design:** Implemented the fixation detection algorithm to filter gaze paths and developed the mechanism for matching ideal gaze paths with user gaze paths.

**Significance:**  
Sweyepe aims to enhance user interaction in mixed reality by introducing more intuitive text-entry solutions. By combining various input modalities and refining user interactions through language modeling, the project seeks to create a more user-friendly and efficient MR environment.
