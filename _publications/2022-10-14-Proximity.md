excerpt: 'This study compares the proximity detection performance of UWB TOA and machine learning-based BLE RSSI during epidemics. The results show UWB TOA achieves slightly higher accuracy with less computational complexity, while BLE RSSI requires extensive training for similar results. The study evaluates both technologies in different environments and postures to assess their robustness for social distancing applications.'

**Duration:** May 2021 â€“ August 2022  
**Role:** Software Engineer  
**Advisor:** [Dr. Kaveh Pahlavan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaveh_Pahlavan) & [Dr. Emmanuel Agu](https://www.wpi.edu/people/faculty/emmanuel)

## Overview
This study compares the proximity detection performance of **Ultra-Wideband (UWB) Time of Arrival (TOA)** and **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) enhanced by machine learning**. By evaluating their accuracy and computational complexity in various environments, including Line-of-Sight (LOS) and Obstructed-Line-of-Sight (OLOS) scenarios, the research aims to shed light on the reliability of UWB and BLE for real-time proximity detection during epidemics.

## My Contributions
- **Data Collection Pipeline:** Designed and developed the **UWB data collection pipeline**, ensuring accurate data capture for a fair comparison with BLE RSSI in identical environments.
- **Software Engineering:** Implemented and optimized the experimental setup, enabling seamless data processing and real-time analysis.

## Contributions of the Study
- **Empirical Comparison:** Provides a comprehensive comparison between **UWB TOA** and **BLE RSSI** enhanced by machine learning for proximity detection.
- **Real-World Scenarios:** Assessed the performance of UWB and BLE in various settings, including both **LOS** and **OLOS** conditions.
- **Key Findings:** Highlighted the advantages of UWB in terms of higher accuracy and lower computational complexity, offering valuable insights for its application in real-time proximity detection during epidemics.
