excerpt: 'This study compares the proximity detection performance of UWB TOA and machine learning-based BLE RSSI during epidemics. The results show UWB TOA achieves slightly higher accuracy with less computational complexity, while BLE RSSI requires extensive training for similar results. The study evaluates both technologies in different environments and postures to assess their robustness for social distancing applications.'

## Overview

This study compares the proximity detection performance of **Ultra-Wideband (UWB) Time of Arrival (TOA)** and **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) enhanced by machine learning** during epidemics. The research evaluates the accuracy and computational complexity of UWB TOA and BLE RSSI in various environments, including Line-of-Sight (LOS) and Obstructed-Line-of-Sight (OLOS) scenarios. The study aims to provide insights into the reliability and robustness of UWB and BLE technologies for proximity detection in real-time applications.

In this project, I served as a **Software Engineer**, contributing to the design of the data collection pipeline for **Ultra-Wideband (UWB) technology**. The project compared the **Time of Arrival (TOA)** method with **RSSI-based BLE** enhanced by machine learning for proximity detection during epidemics. This work involved empirical experiments in various environments and evaluated the reliability of UWB and BLE for detecting proximity in both **Line-of-Sight (LOS)** and **Obstructed-Line-of-Sight (OLOS)** scenarios.

## Key Contributions
- **Data Collection Pipeline**: Developed the **UWB data collection pipeline**, enabling reliable data capture for comparison with BLE RSSI in the same environments.
- **Software Engineering**: Assisted in implementing the experimental setup, ensuring seamless data processing and real-time analysis.

## Novelty
- The study provides an empirical comparison of **UWB TOA** and **BLE RSSI with machine learning** for proximity detection, highlighting UWB's higher accuracy and lower complexity in real-time applications.
