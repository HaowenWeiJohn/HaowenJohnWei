**Duration:** May 2020 â€“ September 2021  
**Role:** Lead Software Engineer  
**Advisor:** [Dr. Kaveh Pahlavan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaveh_Pahlavan) & [Dr. Seyed Zekavat](https://www.wpi.edu/people/faculty/rezaz)

## Overview
As part of this project, I contributed as the **Lead Software Engineer**, helping design the data collection pipeline for the **millimeter-wave radar**. While working on **IndexPen**, I leveraged my expertise in **mmWave radar** to assist in analyzing the interference between **IEEE 802.11ad communication systems** and **60 GHz mmWave radar**. The project aimed to investigate mutual interference and its impact on radar performance, including coverage and precision, as well as the packet loss rate for communication systems.

## Key Contributions
- **Data Collection Pipeline**: Designed and implemented the **mmWave radar** data collection pipeline, ensuring reliable capture and processing of radar signals for the study.
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Shared expertise from the **IndexPen** project to facilitate the understanding of radar interference and its practical implications for HCI and wireless communication.
- **Software Development**: Assisted in configuring the testbed and software for empirical analysis, which helped validate theoretical models with real-world data.

## Novelty
- Provided empirical insights into how **mmWave radar** and **IEEE 802.11ad** devices interfere with each other when operating in overlapping frequencies, demonstrating real-world performance impacts.
