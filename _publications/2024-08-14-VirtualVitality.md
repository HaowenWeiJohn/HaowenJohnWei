excerpt: "My master’s thesis advances brain-computer interfaces (BCI), human-computer interaction (HCI), and extended reality (XR) through three key projects. First, PhysioLabXR, an open-source Python platform, enables real-time, multi-modal BCI and XR experiments, streamlining data processing, visualization, and machine learning. Second, our work on Interactively Assisting Glaucoma Diagnosis employs deep learning to support clinical decision-making, aiming to introduce an AI-based diagnostic tool to CHI 2025. Lastly, the In Search for an Intuitive and Efficient Text-Entry in Mixed Reality project explores innovative text-entry methods in mixed reality for enhanced user interaction. Together, these projects push the boundaries of HCI and BCI research."

**Role:** Project Lead, Lead Software Engineer, Experimenter  

**Advisor:** [Dr. Steven K. Feiner](https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/faculty/steven-feiner) & [Dr. Kaveri Thakoor](https://www.vagelos.columbia.edu/profile/kaveri-thakoor-phd)



**Status:** Submitted to CHI 2025.




**Overview:**  

This project aims to enhance glaucoma diagnosis using an expert knowledge-distilled Vision Transformer, providing AI-augmented insights to ophthalmologists. The system integrates deep learning with medical imaging to focus on key diagnostic features in retinal images. By interactively highlighting areas of interest, the platform facilitates a more nuanced diagnosis process, aiming to support clinical decision-making.






**Key Features:**

- **Expert Model:** Focuses on critical diagnostic features in retinal images using a Vision Transformer distilled with expert knowledge.

- **Augmented Insights:** Highlights areas of interest for ophthalmologists, aiding in the detection and diagnosis of glaucoma.

- **User Study:** Conducted a user study with 15 ophthalmologists to validate the system's utility and effectiveness in a clinical setting.


**My Contributions:**

- **Leadership:** Spearheaded the development of both the front-end and back-end systems, ensuring seamless integration of AI and user interfaces.

- **System Development:** Implemented the Vision Transformer model, trained using domain-specific data to achieve high diagnostic accuracy.

- **User Study:** Designed and conducted the user study with 15 ophthalmologists, gathering feedback to improve the system's usability and diagnostic performance.

- **Experimentation:** Fine-tuned the interaction design to support clinicians effectively, focusing on enhancing decision-making processes in glaucoma diagnosis.


**Significance:**  

This project demonstrates how AI can support clinical decision-making, specifically targeting glaucoma diagnosis. By combining expert knowledge with advanced machine learning techniques, the system aims to improve diagnostic accuracy and efficiency, thereby contributing to better patient outcomes.
